# BigBrainFun

Idea for an app to become more productive by using well known psychological techniques. Because will power is not enough in modern world.

Create an app with variable ratio reinforcement for study. Reward is video, it can be good or it can be bad. (Good=music clips, bad=boring).
Correct answers: correctly made apps/scripts/parts of them. As soon as project finished - play roll in the study reinforcement app. App should be fun and used frequently enough. So it should be used as soon as parts of bigger project are finished, half an hour in the beginning, increasing time after some amount of projects finished. 

## Design and development
App should be to complicated to create. It should be finished in 1 day. Basic version of it is definitely not hard to create. Later the app itself can be used to continue it's own improvement.
Design should be inspired by similar games, using their techniques. At first "roll" going through random videos should be added. Later we can think about currencies and their rewards, limiting fun outside of app system, adding ai to analyze our improvement and even creating whole os-like system designed to reward productivity.

## How to measure if enough is finished
At first it is just a button which should be clicked when project is finished. In the beginning user is typing name of the project that they want to finish. Maybe add functionality to type specific parts of it.
Later system can be improved to analyze code for how much is finished and is there more code added (auto code checks, more code - better).

## To implement:
battle pass system (every day reward, the bigger is your strike the better reward will be)
ranking (comparison to random devs from some online resource)
